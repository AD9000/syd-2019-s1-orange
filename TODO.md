# Important

- rewrite with tests
- reorganise the folder structure
- use backbone methods for navigation / window location
- check integration with back button history
- fix watch/copy task so that index.html is reloaded when in dev mode
- hook up mongo db backend (dev and heroku)
- hook up heroku & fork repo for each team
- make sure snap CI is working
- add build indicator to README.md

- Make a nice index page
- fix watch/copy task so that index.html is reloaded when in dev mode
- make jasmine line numbers useful (tests run using the spec bundle file)


# Nice to have / ideas
- pick a code style and make exec:jscs work properly as part of running tests and the build(?) task
- keyboard shortcuts for watch inputs
- Separate stylesheets for layout/scafloding and actual app
- add automated check for test coverage (set at 80% and fail the build?)

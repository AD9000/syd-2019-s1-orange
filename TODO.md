# Important

- README with full installation instructions
- rewrite with tests
- add automated check for test coverage (set at 80% and fail the build?)
- fix watch/copy task so that index.html is reloaded when in dev mode
- clean up views after navigation (half finished, see code in router)

# Nice to have / ideas
- keyboard shortcuts for watch inputs
- Make a nice index page
- Visuals for actual watch
- Replace jasmine with Mocha

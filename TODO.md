# Important

- simple way to manage input bindings
- Separate stylesheets for layout/scafloding and actual app
- rewrite with tests
- add automated check for test coverage (set at 80% and fail the build?)


# Nice to have / ideas
- fix watch/copy task so that index.html is reloaded when in dev mode
- keyboard shortcuts for watch inputs

# Important

- clean up navigation method so easier to test
- Full test coverage tests
- Notifications
- Mongo DB

- Fix screen size (slightly smaller than 240-by-240-pixels)

- reorganise/simplify the folder structure (again look at benm repo)
- fix watch/copy task so that index.html is reloaded when in dev mode

- example test for loading data

- example of sending a notifications (extra buttons on index page?)
- example of receiving a notification


# Nice to have / ideas
- click and hold for buttons i.e. scrolling
- pick a code style and make exec:jscs work properly as part of running tests and the build(?) task
- keyboard shortcuts for watch inputs
- Separate stylesheets for layout/scafloding and actual app
- add automated check for test coverage (set at 80% and fail the build?)

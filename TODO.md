# Nice to have / ideas
- fix watch/copy task so that index.html is reloaded when in dev mode
- keyboard shortcuts for watch inputs
- Make a nice index page

- add automated check for test coverage (set at 80% and fail the build?)
- make jasmine line numbers useful (tests run using the spec bundle file)

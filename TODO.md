- hook up mongo db backend for dev and heroku (http://kroltech.com/2013/12/boilerplate-web-app-using-backbone-js-expressjs-node-js-mongodb)
- hook up heroku & fork repo for each team

# Nice to have / ideas
- click and hold for buttons i.e. scrolling
- pick a code style and make exec:jscs work properly as part of running tests and the build(?) task
- keyboard shortcuts for watch inputs
- Separate stylesheets for layout/scafloding and actual app
- add automated check for test coverage (set at 80% and fail the build?)

# Important

- SNAP CI setup
- Recompile app when src changes and web server is running (use watchify?)
- README with full installation instructions

- Add example SCSS for views
- Add example model and collection
- Add example navigation
- Watch inputs with HTML elements

# Nice to have / ideas
- keyboard shortcuts for watch inputs
- Make a nice index page
- Visuals for actual watch
- See if we can remove browserify tasks and just use watchify

# Known Issues
- node-sass compatibility problems with different versions of Node (0.10.x v.s. 0.12.x)
- Why do we have to do Backbone.$ = $ after requiring Backbone and jquery?
